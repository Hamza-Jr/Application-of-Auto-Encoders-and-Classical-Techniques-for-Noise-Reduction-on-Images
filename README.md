# Application-of-Auto-Encoders-and-Classical-Techniques-for-Noise-Reduction-on-Images
The objective is to understand the functioning of autoencoders, implement them, and use them for image denoising. We will learn how to prepare a dataset, build an autoencoder model, apply traditional filtering techniques, and evaluate the performance of different methods.
