# Application of Autoencoders and Classical Techniques for Image Denoising

## ðŸ“Œ Objective
The objective of this project is to understand the functioning of autoencoders, implement them, and use them for image denoising. We will learn how to:

### 1. Data Loading and Preparation
- Load the MNIST dataset and add noise.

### 2. Apply Traditional Filtering Techniques

#### 2.1 Visualization of Classical Filtering Results

#### 2.2 Quantitative Evaluation of Filtering
**Interpretation of PSNR results:**

- **Mean Filter (12.28):** Provides basic noise reduction but significantly blurs edges, impacting reconstruction quality.
- **Gaussian Filter (12.43):** Slightly better than the mean filter due to Gaussian weighting, which preserves details better.
- **Median Filter (14.20):** Yields the best results by effectively removing impulse noise while preserving sharp edges, improving fidelity to the original images.

### 3. Build an Autoencoder Model
