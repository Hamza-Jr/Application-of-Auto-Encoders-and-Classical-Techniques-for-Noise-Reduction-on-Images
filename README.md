# Application of Autoencoders and Classical Techniques for Image Denoising

## ðŸ“Œ Objective
The objective of this project is to understand the functioning of autoencoders, implement them, and use them for image denoising. 

This project applies Autoencoders to remove noise from images and compares their performance with classical denoising techniques. Using the MNIST dataset, synthetic noise is added, and denoising methods like Gaussian filtering and median filtering are tested. The performance of each method is evaluated using PSNR and SSIM metrics.

### 1. Data Loading and Preparation
- Load the MNIST dataset and add noise.

### 2. Apply Traditional Filtering Techniques

#### 2.2 Quantitative Evaluation of Filtering
**Interpretation of PSNR results:**

- **Mean Filter (12.28):** Provides basic noise reduction but significantly blurs edges, impacting reconstruction quality.
- **Gaussian Filter (12.43):** Slightly better than the mean filter due to Gaussian weighting, which preserves details better.
- **Median Filter (14.20):** Yields the best results by effectively removing impulse noise while preserving sharp edges, improving fidelity to the original images.
